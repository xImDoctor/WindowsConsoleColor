# WindowsConsoleColor

This work is my attempt to change the color of the output symbols in the default Windows output console.
This code based on the WinAPI (uses Windows.h), so it is useful only for Windows I guess, but maybe you have any ideas how to use it in Linux or somewhere else.
It is also just a simple demo, so I know that it could be further modified and optimized.
